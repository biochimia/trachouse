You will need to obtain a copy of lighthouse.rb from the Lighthouse API
http://forum.activereload.net/forums/6/topics/44

Please read all commented sections, as most have something you will need to change directly below it

USE:

  @tickets = populate_tickets # grabs all tickets from trac
  import_tickets(@tickets) # import tickets to lighthouse
  # profit
  # you may want to inspect @tickets or only import a couple of tickets to verify format before processing all tickets
